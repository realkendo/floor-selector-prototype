# 🏢 Floor Selector Prototype

## 📖 Overview

**Floor Selector Prototype** is a React-based web application that allows users to browse and explore apartment layouts in a multi-tower building. Users can select a tower, choose a floor, and view detailed information about available apartment layouts — including metadata such as **price, amenities, and availability**.

The UI features **smooth animations** and a **modern, responsive design**.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- **React** – Core UI library for building the application.
- **Framer Motion** – For smooth and interactive animations (e.g., image hover effects).
- **React Scripts** – Provides configuration and scripts via Create React App.
- **Tailwind CSS** *(assumed)* – For utility-first styling (used in code, not listed in `package.json`).

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

-  **Static data** – No backend or live data; all content is hardcoded
-  **No authentication** – User accounts and personalization are not supported
-  **No real booking** – Apartment availability is static and non-interactive
-  **No filter or search functionality** – Users cannot sort or filter apartment listings
-  **Placeholder images** – Used instead of real property photos
