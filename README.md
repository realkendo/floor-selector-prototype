# 🏢 Floor Selector Prototype

## 📖 Overview

**Floor Selector Prototype** is a React-based web application that allows users to browse and explore apartment layouts in a multi-tower building. Users can select a tower, choose a floor, and view detailed information about available apartment layouts — including metadata such as **price, amenities, and availability**.

The UI features **smooth animations** and a **modern, responsive design**.
